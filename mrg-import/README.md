# MRG Import Tool

The **[MRG](https://tno-terminology-design.github.io/tev2-specifications/docs/specs/files/mrg) Import Tool ([MRG importer](https://tno-terminology-design.github.io/tev2-specifications/docs/specs/tools/mrg-import))** ensures that the [scope](https://tno-terminology-design.github.io/tev2-specifications/docs/terms/scope) within which it is run, obtains a local copy of all [MRGs](https://tno-terminology-design.github.io/tev2-specifications/docs/specs/files/mrg) that are available in the [scopes](https://tno-terminology-design.github.io/tev2-specifications/docs/terms/scope) that are mentioned in the [`scopes` section](https://tno-terminology-design.github.io/tev2-specifications/docs/specs/files/saf#scopes) of its [SAF](https://tno-terminology-design.github.io/tev2-specifications/docs/specs/files/saf). This makes life easy for various tools, e.g., the [MRGT](https://tno-terminology-design.github.io/tev2-specifications/docs/specs/tools/mrgt) and the [TRRT](https://tno-terminology-design.github.io/tev2-specifications/docs/specs/tools/trrt), that can now assume that all [MRGs](https://tno-terminology-design.github.io/tev2-specifications/docs/specs/files/mrg) that they may need to consult in order to do their job, are readily available.

Please refer to the [MRG Import Tool specifications](https://tno-terminology-design.github.io/tev2-specifications/docs/specs/tools/mrg-import) for more information.
