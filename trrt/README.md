# Term Reference Resolution Tool (TRRT)

**The Term Ref Resolution Tool ([TRRT](https://tno-terminology-design.github.io/tev2-specifications/docs/specs/tools/trrt))** is a [TEv2 text conversion tool](https://tno-terminology-design.github.io/tev2-specifications/docs/terms/tev2-text-conversion-tool) that takes files that contain so-called [TermRefs](https://tno-terminology-design.github.io/tev2-specifications/docs/terms/term-ref) as inputs, and that outputs (a copy of) these files in which these [TermRefs](https://tno-terminology-design.github.io/tev2-specifications/docs/terms/term-ref) are converted into [renderable refs](https://tno-terminology-design.github.io/tev2-specifications/docs/terms/renderable-ref).

Please refer to the [TRRT specifications](https://tno-terminology-design.github.io/tev2-specifications/docs/specs/tools/trrt) for more information.
